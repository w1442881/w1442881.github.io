    <h1>DESGN328 portfolio</h1>

    <h2>Why this site?</h2>

    <p>This site was designed to meet the "portfolio" requirement for my Engineering Design 328 class at Los Rios Community College.</p>

    <p>The idea for this site had been brewing in my head for a while. I've always had an interest in information
        design, but did not have the opportunity to explore technical site navigation through graphs, or to sort my own content in a 
        way that was actually useful to me.</p>
        
    <p>I got the opportunity to view some of the sample portfolios for other classes put together by some very talented engineering design 
students at Los Rios. Despite the impressive work they had done, I felt skeptical about the purported goal of the portfolio
as a job-hunting aid. 
It seems to me like I have generated, then abandoned, a lot of content in my time, and didn't feel that showcasing 
my talents for a nonexistent potential employer was reason enough to spend all that effort. 
I feel at this stage in my life that I've come to terms
 with my actual needs, which revolve around deemphasizing things I don't like 
 while spending more time on things I truly enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>Hence the dream: what if I abandoned the concept of building a traditional portfolio 
        or of designing a hierarchical web site
        and instead allowed the content I placed there to grow organically, as I was creating it? 
        And, what if I put content there I actually could actually look up, reference, reuse and even grow, rather than focusing on 
        showcasing unremarkable talents? This would give me the opportunity to work on things that were truly remarkable.
        </p>
        <p>I haven't yet achieved any of these goals, and
        this site is not quite the realization of that
        dream, given the technical difficulties which I've uncovered while working on it.
        But it does point the way at achieving just that, over time, and with completely free tools.
        Parts of this site have been
        designed in such a way, and the result has so far been very encouraging, but all of it with the caveat that my own time
        is neither cheap nor plentiful. 
    </p>
